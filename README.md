first compile program

2 command line arguments, input txt file and output text file and either --simple or --fancy

--simple just gets binary strings and converts them

--fancy tries to visually display them in a more appealing manner, I do have a suspicion that fancy might not work on all machines because of the string that it uses

input text file should have the first line be the # of ticks and all lines below that input lines
input lines do not need to be the same size
